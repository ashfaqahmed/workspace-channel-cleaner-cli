## ‚ú® Features

### Fast & Efficient
- **Concurrent Processing**: Uses goroutines for efficient API calls
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple channels at once
- **Lightweight**: No dependencies on UI frameworks

### üîç Smart Filtering
- **Time-based**: Find channels inactive for N days
- **Keyword-based**: Filter channels by name patterns
- **Type Selection**: Target public, private, or both channel types
- **Skip List Protection**: Important channels are automatically protected

### Safety First
- **Interactive Confirmation**: Always asks before leaving channels
- **Hardcoded Skip List**: Protects critical channels from accidental removal
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure without data loss
- **Rate Limit Respect**: Never overwhelms Slack's API

### üí° Best Practices for Rate Limit Management

To avoid hitting Slack's API rate limits, use specific search criteria:

**‚úÖ Recommended (Narrow searches):**
```bash
# Specific keyword with time filter
./workspace-cleaner-cli --keyword "test-2023" --days 30

# Only public channels with specific term
./workspace-cleaner-cli --keyword "deprecated" --types public

# Short time range for initial testing
./workspace-cleaner-cli --days 7 --keyword "old"
```

**‚ùå Avoid (Broad searches):**
```bash
# Too broad - may hit rate limits
./workspace-cleaner-cli --days 365

# Very generic keyword
./workspace-cleaner-cli --keyword "test"
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Start with smaller time ranges (`--days 7` or `--days 30`)
- Use specific keywords that match your channel naming patterns
- Combine filters to narrow down results
- Use `--verbose` to monitor API call progress

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp example.env .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your Slack API token:
```env
# Required: Your Slack API token
SLACK_API_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-bot-token-here
```

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude it.

### API Token Requirements

Your Slack API token must have the following scopes:

- `channels:history` - Read channel message history
- `groups:history` - Read private channel history
- `conversations.list` - List all channels
- `conversations.leave` - Leave channels

### Getting Your API Token

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Go to "OAuth & Permissions"
4. Add the required scopes listed above
5. Install the app to your workspace
6. Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxb-`) or "User OAuth Token" (starts with `xoxp-`)

## üõ°Ô∏è Protected Channels

The application includes a configurable skip list to protect important channels. By default, it protects common critical channels like:

- `general`, `company-announcements`
- Team channels: `team-leads`, `support-example`, `dev-team`
- Security channels: `security`, `infrastructure`, `admin-only`
- And many more critical channels

### Customizing the Skip List

You can customize which channels to skip by editing the `skip-channels.json` file:

```json
{
  "skip_channels": [
    "general",
    "company-announcements",
    "team-leads",
    "support-example",
    "dev-team",
    "infrastructure",
    "security",
    "hr-announcements",
    "product-updates"
  ]
}
```

**Note**: If the JSON file is missing or invalid, the application will use a built-in default skip list for safety.

    ./workspace-cleaner-cli --days 60 --types public
  env:
    SLACK_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_API_TOKEN }}
```

### Docker Usage

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o workspace-cleaner-cli main.go

FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/workspace-cleaner-cli /usr/local/bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["workspace-cleaner-cli"]
```

## üîí Security

- **Token Protection**: API tokens are never logged or displayed
- **Skip List**: Protects important channels from accidental removal
- **Confirmation**: Double-confirmation for destructive actions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure without data loss
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects Slack's API rate limits

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"SLACK_API_TOKEN not set"**
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains the token
- Check that the token has the required scopes

**"Rate limit hit"**
- The application automatically handles rate limits
- Wait for the retry mechanism to complete
- **üí° Tip**: Make your search criteria more specific to reduce API calls:
  - Use `--keyword "specific-term"` instead of broad searches
  - Combine `--days` with `--keyword` for targeted filtering
  - Use `--types public` or `--types private` to limit scope
  - Start with smaller time ranges (e.g., `--days 7`) before larger ones

**"No matching channels found"**
- Check your filter settings
- Verify you're a member of channels
- Review the skip list for protected channels

**"You must provide either --days or --keyword"**
- Provide at least one filtering criteria
- Use `--days 30` for time-based filtering
- Use `--keyword test` for keyword-based filtering

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose output for detailed logging:

```bash
./workspace-cleaner-cli --days 30 --verbose
```
